## About This Project

<!--
CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION FOR YOUR PROJECT
Describe your project so Windsurf understands the context:

- Project name and purpose:
- Tech stack:
- Key frameworks/libraries:
- Architecture pattern (e.g., MVC, microservices, serverless):
- Any important conventions specific to this project:

Example:
This is a Next.js e-commerce application using TypeScript, Prisma ORM,
and Tailwind CSS. We follow a feature-based folder structure and use
React Query for server state management.
-->

## Project Context

This is a software project that uses modern development practices. Analyze the codebase to understand:
- The tech stack and frameworks in use
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Project structure and architecture

## Core Principles

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Readability First**
   - Write self-documenting code with clear naming
   - Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add comments only for complex logic or "why" explanations

2. **Consistency**
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
   - Match the style of surrounding code
   - Use established conventions for the tech stack

3. **Simplicity**
   - Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Don't over-engineer; solve the current problem

4. **Security**
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials
   - Validate and sanitize all user input
   - Use parameterized queries for databases
   - Follow OWASP guidelines for web applications
   - Be cautious with dependencies; prefer well-maintained packages

### Development Practices

1. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Maintain existing test coverage
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Never swallow exceptions silently

3. **Performance**
   - Consider performance implications of changes
   - Avoid N+1 queries and unnecessary loops
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Profile before optimizing

4. **Accessibility**
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for web interfaces
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works
   - Provide alt text for images

## Response Guidelines

### When Writing Code

- Provide complete, working solutions
- Include necessary imports and dependencies
- Add appropriate error handling
- Consider edge cases
- Follow the project's formatting standards (Prettier, EditorConfig, or project-specific tools)

### When Reviewing Code

Report issues in this format:
- 🔴 **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, breaking bugs
- 🟡 **Warning**: Performance issues, code smells, potential bugs
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Improvements, better practices, optimizations

### When Explaining

- Be concise but thorough
- Use examples when helpful
- Reference relevant documentation
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations

## File-Specific Guidelines

### Configuration Files
- Validate syntax before suggesting changes
- Explain the purpose of each setting
- Warn about security-sensitive options

### Test Files
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests logically
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both happy path and error cases

### Documentation
- Keep README files up to date
- Document public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Note any breaking changes

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages
Follow Conventional Commits:
- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `test:` test additions/changes
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

### Branch Strategy
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation
- `refactor/` for refactoring

## What to Avoid

- Don't suggest changes that break existing functionality without warning
- Don't add dependencies without justification
- Don't ignore existing patterns for personal preference
- Don't write overly complex solutions for simple problems
- Don't skip error handling for brevity
- Don't hardcode values that should be configurable

## Context Awareness

Before making suggestions:
1. Check if similar functionality exists in the codebase
2. Understand the project's architecture decisions
3. Consider the impact on other parts of the system
4. Review related tests and documentation

## Tech Stack Detection

Analyze the project to identify:
- Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Frameworks (React, Vue, Django, Express, etc.)
- Testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, etc.)
- Build tools (Vite, webpack, etc.)
- CI/CD configuration

Adjust recommendations based on the detected stack.

## Windsurf Tips

### @ References

Use these to provide context in Cascade:

| Reference | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `@filename` | Reference a specific file |
| `@foldername` | Reference an entire folder |
| `@codebase` | Search the entire codebase |
| `@web` | Search the web for information |
| `@docs` | Reference documentation |
| `@terminal` | Reference terminal output |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + L` | Open Cascade chat |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + I` | Inline edit mode |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + L` | Add selection to chat |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Send message in Cascade |
| `Escape` | Dismiss suggestions |

### Best Practices

- Use `@codebase` to find related code before making changes
- Use Cascade for multi-file refactoring and complex tasks
- Reference specific files with `@filename` for targeted edits
- Break complex requests into smaller, focused steps
- Review generated code before accepting changes
- Use `@terminal` to reference command output for debugging
