## What & Why

> **DELETE:** Replace the example text below with your actual problem/solution, then delete this instruction block.

**The Problem:**
Developers waste hours manually configuring CI/CD pipelines for each new microservice, leading to inconsistent deployments and configuration drift.

**Our Solution:**
This tool auto-generates standardized CI/CD configurations from a single template, ensuring consistency across all services while reducing setup time from hours to minutes.
