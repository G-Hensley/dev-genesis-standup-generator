TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES (delete this section when using the template)
============================================================================

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA vs DEFINITION OF DONE:
- Acceptance Criteria: Task-specific requirements unique to this issue
- Definition of Done: Universal standards that apply to ALL tasks

This template is designed for tasks generated by the AI-assisted planning
workflow. When using import-issues.sh, tasks are created with structured
data from the planning phase.

The JSON format expected by import-issues.sh:
{
  "title": "Task title",
  "body": "Task description with acceptance criteria",
  "labels": ["phase-1", "area: frontend"],
  "milestone": "Phase 1"
}

See docs/WORKFLOW.md for the complete idea-to-code workflow.
See prompts/ISSUES_JSON_SCHEMA.md for the full JSON specification.
