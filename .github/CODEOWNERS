# CODEOWNERS - Define code ownership for automatic review requests
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Default owner for everything in the repo
# Replace OWNER with your GitHub username or team
* @OWNER

# Examples of more granular ownership (uncomment and customize as needed):

# *.md @OWNER

# GitHub configuration
# /.github/ @OWNER

# CI/CD workflows
# /.github/workflows/ @OWNER

# Security-sensitive files
# /SECURITY.md @OWNER
# /.github/workflows/security-scan.yml @OWNER

# Configuration files
# /*.json @OWNER
# /*.yaml @OWNER
# /*.yml @OWNER

# Source code (customize for your structure)
# /src/ @OWNER
# /lib/ @OWNER
# /app/ @OWNER

# Tests
# /tests/ @OWNER
# /test/ @OWNER
# /__tests__/ @OWNER
# *.test.* @OWNER
# *.spec.* @OWNER

# Infrastructure
# /infrastructure/ @OWNER
# /terraform/ @OWNER
# /k8s/ @OWNER
# Dockerfile* @OWNER
# docker-compose* @OWNER

# Database

# ============================================================================
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (Delete this section when customizing)
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Replace @OWNER with your GitHub username (e.g., @johndoe)
# 2. For organizations, you can use team names (e.g., @org/team-name)
# 3. Uncomment and customize the sections that apply to your project
# 4. Add additional patterns as your project structure requires
#
# Pattern matching:
# - * matches all files
# - *.js matches all JavaScript files
# - /docs/ matches the docs directory at root
# - docs/ matches any docs directory anywhere
# - /src/**/*.ts matches all TypeScript files in src and subdirectories
#
# ============================================================================
