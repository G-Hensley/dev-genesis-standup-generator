# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe! We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you find.

## Supported Versions

<!-- Update this table to reflect which versions of your project currently receive security updates -->

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report them using one of the following methods:

### Option 1: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred)

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Fill out the form with the details of the vulnerability

This allows for private discussion and coordinated disclosure.

### Option 2: Email

<!-- Replace with your actual security contact email -->
Send an initial email to: **security@example.com**

In your initial email, please include:

- A brief, general description of the vulnerability (without sensitive details)
- Your preferred method of secure communication

We will respond promptly and establish a secure channel to discuss the full details of the vulnerability.

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
- **Affected component(s)** - File paths, URLs, or functionality involved
- **Steps to reproduce** - Clear, step-by-step instructions
- **Proof of concept** - Code, screenshots, or videos demonstrating the issue
- **Impact assessment** - What could an attacker potentially achieve?
- **Suggested fix** (optional) - If you have recommendations for remediation
- **Your environment** - OS, browser, version, relevant configuration

## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding promptly to security reports:

| Action | Timeline |
| ------ | -------- |
| Initial acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Status update | Within 7 days |
| Resolution target | Within 90 days (depending on complexity) |

We will keep you informed throughout the process and work with you to understand and validate the reported issue.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** process:

1. **Report received** - We acknowledge receipt and begin investigation
2. **Validation** - We confirm the vulnerability and assess its impact
3. **Remediation** - We develop and test a fix
4. **Release** - We deploy the fix and prepare security advisory
5. **Public disclosure** - We publish details after users have had time to update

We kindly ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption
- Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:

- **Authorized** under applicable anti-hacking laws
- **Exempt** from DMCA restrictions on circumvention
- **Lawful and beneficial** to the overall security of the internet

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Act in good faith to comply with this policy
- Report vulnerabilities directly to us before public disclosure
- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption

## Recognition

We believe in recognizing the valuable contributions of security researchers:

<!-- Customize based on your preferences -->
- Reporters will be credited in security advisories (unless they prefer anonymity)
- We maintain a [Security Hall of Fame](#hall-of-fame) for acknowledged contributors

<!-- Optional: Remove or expand this section based on your resources -->
<!--
### Bug Bounty Program
Currently, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. However, we deeply appreciate your contributions to keeping our project secure.

## Hall of Fame

We'd like to thank the following individuals for responsibly disclosing security issues:

<!-- Add recognized reporters here -->
| Researcher | Date | Issue |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- |
| — | — | — |

## Questions?

If you have questions about this policy or are unsure whether an issue qualifies as a security vulnerability, please reach out. We'd rather hear about potential issues than have them go unreported.
